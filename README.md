# Spark ETL Practice

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my hands-on practice using PySpark for data processing and ETL operations.  
It demonstrates core Spark concepts including transformations, joins, and scenario-based exercises.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- PySpark
- Hadoop (Local Setup)

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- Reading data from files
- Data transformations
- Joins and aggregations
- Scenario-based Spark problems
- ETL-style processing logic

## 🎯 Purpose
Built as part of my Data Engineering learning journey to strengthen Spark and big data processing skills.
